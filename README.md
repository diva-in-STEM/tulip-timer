### A beautiful pomodoro timer for studying/work

This is a simple pomodoro timer with 20 minute work and 5 minute rest sections. You can start/stop the timer with the play button on the left or the space bar then restart it if needed using the button on the right. Change to a dark theme with the button in the top right corner.
